## About

This repository serves as an archive of my coursework for the Oregon State University course "Digital Logic Design". It focuses primarily on FPGA development and hardware simulation.

This software runs on a Intel/terasIC [DE10-Lite](https://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&No=1021) FPGA supplied as part of the Intel FPGA University Program.
